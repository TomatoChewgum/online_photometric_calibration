# Online Photometric Calibration

Recent direct visual odometry and SLAM algorithms have demonstrated
impressive levels of precision. However, they require a photometric
camera calibration in order to achieve competitive results. Hence, the
respective algorithm cannot be directly applied to an
off-the-shelf-camera or to a video sequence acquired with an unknown
camera. In this work we propose a method for online photometric
calibration which enables to process auto exposure videos with visual
odometry precisions that are on par with those of photometrically
calibrated videos. Our algorithm recovers the exposure times of
consecutive frames, the camera response function, and the attenuation
factors of the sensor irradiance due to vignetting. Gain robust KLT
feature tracks are used to obtain scene point correspondences as input
to a nonlinear optimization framework. We show that our approach can
reliably calibrate arbitrary video sequences by evaluating it on
datasets for which full photometric ground truth is available. We
further show that our calibration can improve the performance of a
state-of-the-art direct visual odometry method that works solely on
pixel intensities, calibrating for photometric parameters in an online
fashion in realtime. For more details please refer to our paper.

**Note:** *This is a preliminary release. You should consider this
research code in beta. All interfaces are subject to change.*

## Install

We support Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04, and macOS, but it might work on a
variety of other platforms that meet the dependency requirements.

### Dependencies

The main dependencies are cmake 3.2 or later, a C++11 compiler, and
OpenCV 2.4.

#### Ubuntu 14.04

On Ubuntu 14.04 you need to get a more recent version of cmake.

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:george-edison55/cmake-3.x
```

Now continue to install dependencies like for Ubuntu 16.04.

#### Ubuntu 16.04

**Required:**

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install \
    build-essential \
    g++ \
    cmake \
    libopencv-dev
```

**Optional:**

CCache can help you speed up repeated builds.

*Note:* You need at least cmake version 3.4 for ccache to work
 automatically.

```
sudo apt-get install ccache
```

### macOS

We assume you have installed [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).


**Required:**

```
brew install cmake opencv@2
```

**Optional:**

```
brew install ccache
```

### Compile

Start in the package directory.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```

Optionally you can install the built libraries and executables.

```
sudo make install
```


## Usage

### Online calibration

**Example usage:**

Download sequence of the TUMmono VO dataset.

```
SEQ=30
wget http://vision.in.tum.de/mono/dataset/sequence_$SEQ.zip
unzip sequence_$SEQ.zip
unzip -d sequence_$SEQ/images sequence_$SEQ/images.zip
```

Run online calibration.

```
build/bin/online_pcalib_demo -i sequence_$SEQ/images --exposure-gt-file sequence_$SEQ/times.txt
```

*Note:* Currently the implementation is not suitable for
 fisheye-lenses with black borders around the image, which includes
 some of the TUMmono VO dataset sequences as well as the TUM VI
 dataset sequences.

### Batch calibration

Online calibration runs the code in a multithreaded way in parallel on the CPU.
If tracking and backend optimization should be performed sequentially and real time 
performance is not required, the system can be run in batch calibration mode.
For running in batch mode, simply add the command line option

```
  --calibration-mode batch
```

For batch calibration you might want to use the exposure times from the optimization
backend rather than the rapidly estimated exposure times from the frontend. In order 
to extract more keyframes to the backend optimizer, the run_settings parameters have to
be adjusted.

These parameters can be changed by manually setting:

```
  --nr-active-frames INT      Maximum number of frames to be stored in the database.
  --keyframe-spacing INT      Number of frames that keyframes are apart in the backend optimizer.
  --min-keyframes-valid INT   Minimum number of frames a feature has to be tracked to be considered for optimization.
```

### Command line options
